\paragraph{Problem}
Unreal Tournament 3 is a game with a simple objective: Capture the enemy flag. However simple this objective may seem and however trivial a task it can be for a human, this task is already quite extensive for a machine.
\paragraph{Background}
Unreal Tournament 3 is the third instalment in the Unreal Tournament series, a series of so called \emph{First Person Shooter} games. It has multiple modes of games: Death Match, killing as many enemies as you can. Team Death Match is the same, only with teams instead of everybody versus everybody. The last is Capture the Flag, in which there are two teams, each with a flag. The objective is to walk to your enemies' flag, pick it up and bring it back to your flag to capture it. We will focus on the latter category.
\paragraph{Main Question}
Our objective is to write a so-called \emph{agent} which is capable to defeat computer controlled enemies written by the game's programmers. Our team will consist of four agents who will talk to each other to maximise their efficiency. Our team will take on a team of three enemies of the highest possible level.
