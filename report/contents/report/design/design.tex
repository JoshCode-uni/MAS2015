\chapter{Design of an Agent System}
\section{System Structure}
Our system has three distinct roles for our four agents:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first being the \emph{Carrier}, designed to be optimal in retrieving and capturing the enemy flag. Once the flag has been captured, the \emph{Carrier} will often be defended by one of the \emph{Roamers}, for added security.
\item The second is the \emph{Defender}, designed to defend our flag and home base. If our flag has been captured, he should chase the enemy flag carrier and re-capture the flag.
\item The last role is the \emph{Roamer}, of which there are two agents running in a match. They are designed to generally walk over the entire map, getting a lot of weapons, health and armour and disrupting the enemy team. Additionally, they can capture the flag if they have nothing to collect or go after the enemy flag carrier if our flag is stolen.
\end{enumerate}
