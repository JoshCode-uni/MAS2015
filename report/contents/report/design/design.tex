\chapter{Design of an Agent System}

\section{System Structure}
Our system has three distinct roles for our four in-game agents:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first being the \emph{Flag Carrier}, designed to be optimal in retrieving and capturing the enemy flag. Once the flag has been captured, the \emph{ Flag Carrier} will often be defended by one of the \emph{Roamers}, for added security.

\item The second is the \emph{Flag Defender}, designed to defend our flag and home base. If our flag has been captured, he should chase the enemy flag carrier and re-capture the flag if he knows where the flag is. If he does not know, he should roam around the enemy base, laying an ambush.

\item The final role is the \emph{Roamer}, a class which will be assigned to two of the bots. They are designed to cross the entire map, constantly improving themselves by collecting weapons, health and armour and disrupting the enemy team. Additionally, they can capture the flag if they are powerful enough, return our flag whenever it is stolen, or protect the flag carrier when he is in possession of the flag.
\end{enumerate}

Besides roles assigned to the actual bots, we have a fourth role, called \emph{the Overlord}. \emph{The Overlord} does not control a bot and as such does not directly participate in the game. He can be seen as a commander, keeping track of where the flag is and assigning different roles to the bots in the game.

\subsection{Justification}
We chose these four roles to divide the work that needs to be done in order to win the match.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[Carrier] We wanted a dedicated role that would be concerned with getting the enemy flag, whatever it may take without distractions. We think that in this way, we will consistently keep scoring points.

\item[Defender] We also wanted a dedicated role that would stay with our flag so that the enemy team will have a hard time capturing our flag. He also chases the enemy flag carrier so that we keep track of his location for a short while, so that the \emph{Roamer} agents will know where to look for the enemy flag carrier if the \emph{Defender} can't take him out.

\item[Roamer] Finally we had two agents left to assign a role. We think it is best to let two agents roam the map so that if our flag is captured and the \emph{Defender} couldn't stop them, we have two agents who are really powerful, for they have been gathering armour, weapons and health, who can easily take down the enemy flag carrier.
\end{enumerate}
