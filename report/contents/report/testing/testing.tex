\chapter{Testing Approach and Results}

INTRODUCTION

\section{Testing approach}
During the project, we have used multiple forms of testing, with various degrees of success. The main problem faced was the fact that we could in essence only test the entire system, as there would be no feasible way to test parts of the game. This severely impairs testing, as it decreases both controllability and observability, condemning us to end-to-end testing. Another factor which made testing difficult was the (apparent) non-deterministic behaviour of the native bots.\\
\\
Our first testing approach was aimed at taking non-deterministic behaviour out of the equation. The plan was to create very simple maps, in which both our bots and the native bots could only do a single thing. The idea was quickly abandoned, as creating the maps was time-consuming and tweaking them in order to make the bots behave in the expected way was close to impossible.\\
\\
A second testing approach was considered after we noticed we could control bots of the enemies' team as well. This allowed us to create bots which would behave exactly as expected, in a desired deterministic way. Again, time was an issue, as programming a new bot for every (few) testing scenario was unadvisable, especially taking into account the actual data we gathered this way.\\
\\
After this, any form of automatic testing was deemed inefficient. Instead, it was determined that it would be replaced by careful monitoring the environment, looking for unwanted behaviour using checklists. Apart from this, the system would be tested by occasionally pitching various combinations of roles against a human player, which could create situations himself, such as getting the flag or shooting at a bot.\\

\section{Kinds of bugs}
\emph{This section was written on the 2nd of June, 2015. These bugs were present at that time.}
\newline\newline
The kinds of bugs found by our testing are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bots being stuck somewhere on the map.
\item Bots not properly resetting their view after looking somewhere.
\item Bots executing actions that were not defined at all, resulting in the bot doing nothing.
\item The bot terminating when it has nothing to do
\item The bot getting stuck when it has nothing to do
\todo{Add more bugs to the final version!}
\end{itemize}
