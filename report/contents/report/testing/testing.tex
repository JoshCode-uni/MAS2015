\section{Kinds of bugs}
\emph{This section was written on the 2nd of June, 2015. These bugs were present at that time.}
\newline\newline
The kinds of bugs found by our testing are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Bots being stuck somewhere on the map.
\item Bots not properly resetting their view after looking somewhere.
\item Bots executing actions that were not defined at all, resulting in the bot doing nothing.
\item The bot terminating when it has nothing to do
\item The bot getting stuck when it has nothing to do
\todo{Add more bugs to the final version!}
\end{itemize}
