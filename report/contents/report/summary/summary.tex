\chapter*{Summary}
The purpose of this project is to create a multi-agent system and win a game of Capture The Flag in the Unreal Tournament 3 environment against its native bots. The main question was how to accomplish this goal. The answer to this question involves three different components: we need to see the problem from a design perspective, as well as from a technical perspective. Besides this, we also need to address solve bugs and prevent erroneous behaviour. \\

In order to claim victory against our opponents, we designed three distinct roles. One bot in our multi-agent system is the Flag Carrier. This bot tries to take the enemy flag and return it to our own base. Another bot will have the role of Flag Defender. That bot will stay at our own base in order to protect our flag from enemy bots. Last but not least, our team consists of two Roamers. Their job is improve themselves by collecting the best weapons and armour, as well as assisting the Flag Carrier and Flag Defender with their tasks. We also make use of an Overlord, which allows us to communicate efficiently in the team. Furthermore, we make our bots prefer certain weapons based at the distance to the, in order to take them down efficiently. \\

Secondly, we need to have an efficient way to produce code to make the bots run smoothly. In order to make the bots run in a smooth manner, we needed to refactor our code. This was an essential part of the process of making a functioning bot-team, because otherwise, the processes needed to make the bots function were too heavy, resulting in unwanted delays. \\

Last but not least, we needed to fix bugs and other technical problems. The game-breaking issues (such as bots crashing on the spot) had to be addressed immediately, because otherwise we weren't able to win games against native bots. The minor bugs did not need to be fixed immediately, as they were less important to the outcome of our matches. \\

All of these processes are discussed with more detail in the rest of the report.
