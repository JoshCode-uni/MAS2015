The purpose of this project is to create a multi-agent system and win a game of Capture The Flag in the Unreal Tournament 3 environment against its native bots. The main question was how to accomplish this goal. The answer to this question involves three different components: the problem needs to be viewed from a design perspective, as well as from a technical perspective. Besides, addressing bugs and preventing  erroneous behaviour is also crucial. \\

Firstly, in order to claim victory against native bots, three distinct roles were designed. One bot in the multi-agent system is the Flag Carrier. This bot tries to take the enemy flag and return it to our base. Another bot will have the role of Flag Defender. This particular bot will stay at our base in order to protect our flag from enemy bots. Last but not least, our team consists of two Roamers. Their job is improve themselves by collecting the best weapons and armour, as well as assisting the Flag Carrier and Flag Defender with their tasks. An Overlord is also used, which allows efficient communication in the team. Furthermore, the bots are made to prefer certain weapons based on their distance to target, in order to take down enemies efficiently. \\

Secondly, an efficient way to produce code was needed to make the bots run smoothly and, thus refactoring was needed. This was an essential part of the process of making a functioning team of bots, since otherwise, the processes needed to make the bots function were too resource demanding, resulting in unwanted delays. \\

Last but not least, bugs and other technical problems needed to be addressed. The game-breaking issues (such as bots crashing on the spot) had to be addressed immediately, because otherwise the bots weren't able to win games against native bots. The minor bugs did not need to be fixed immediately, as they were less important to the outcome of our matches. \\
