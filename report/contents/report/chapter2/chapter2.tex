Using the MoSCoW method, where the M stands for Must, the S for Should, the C for Could and the W for Won't, we decided to put all the minimum requirements under the M. All the other functionalities, which are use to better our bots, are placed under the S. Everything that was taken into consideration, but eventually denied, because it was to hard to implement, was placed under the C. The rest are placed under the W.

The minimum functionality is basically to grab the enemy flag and return it. And eventually you should win the game of Capture the Flag. This taken to account, we decided to make it our number one priority. We also knew that by only implementing this, we would definitely lose.
