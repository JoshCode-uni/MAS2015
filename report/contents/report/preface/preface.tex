\chapter*{Preface}
Multi-agent systems are becoming more and more important these days, where many tasks are automated. Many machines are no longer relying on operators, instead having their own intelligence. Often these machines need to cooperate with other robots of their own kind. A major application of this is in the gaming industry, as games often contain a lot of non player controlled entities that have to play along with the player. Bots in games are often a good example of a multi-agent system.

In order to demonstrate our knowledge from and proficiency in logic based artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems, this project will be aimed at creating a multi-agent system. The objective in this project is therefore to create a multi-agent system controlling the bots and competing with other bots in the game Unreal Tournament 3. 
    
This report is intended to be read by supervising professors, teaching assistants, fellow students, as well as anyone whom might be interested in the multi-agent system made by us.
