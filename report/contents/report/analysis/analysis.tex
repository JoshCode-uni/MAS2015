\chapter{Analysis of the UT environment}
In this chapter ten scenarios and their characteristics are analysed. Each of them arises frequently in the game and handling them the right way greatly improves the chance of winning.\\
The ten scenarios are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A bot is near the flag. \\
	His goal is to grab the enemy flag, and as soon as he percepts he is holding the flag, he will alert the overlord and his goal is to carry their flag back to his base. He should take the shortest route to his own base, killing every enemy he might run into on the way there.\\
	\item The flag defender encounters an enemy. \\
	The flag defender is constantly roaming around his own base. Whenever he encounters an enemy, his priority is to kill him. As soon as he loses the enemy, he should return to roaming around his flag base, possibly collecting health and/or other pickups if the need arises.\\
	\item The roamer spots an enemy. \\
	If a roamer sees an enemy, his priority is to kill them, even if it means chasing them. After the fight is over, the roamer should continue to roam the map, possible collecting health and/or other pickups. \\
	\item One of the roamers is hit. 
	When the enemy hits a roamer, causing his health to drop below 100, the bot will adopt a new goal to leave the battlefield and grab a health pickup. This will only happen if health packs are available. When his health reaches 100 again, he goes back to running around the map looking for enemies.\\
	\item When the roamers are low on ammo, or when they see a new weapon, or armor. If they percept that they are low on ammo, the new goal is to grab the ammo. When they have grabbed it, they will continue with what they were doing. If the bot sees a weapon, he will first check if he already has the weapon. If he does not have, his goal will be to pick the weapon up. This also counts for armor, he will first check if he already has this specific armor, if not, he will try to grab it. \\
	\item When the roamers end up capturing the flag. If the roamers does not have any goals, he would be inactive. When he reaches this point, he should go to the enemy base and try to grab the flag. Once he captures the flag, he basically becomes a Flag Capturer, and he will try to deliver it back to his own base. If he encounters an enemy while holding the flag, he will try to defeat him, and when that happens, he will continue delivering the flag.\\ 
	\item When the Flag Capturer sees a weapon. He percepts that there is a weapon, then he looks at his beliefs and checks if he does not own that weapon already. If he owns it, he will continue trying to capture the enemy flag. If he does not owns it, he will adopt the goal to pickup the weapon. After the grabbing it he will continue trying to capture the enemy flag.\\
	\item When the enemy captures our flag. If the flag defender is in the neighborhood, and he sees the enemy, he will try to kill him. This also counts for the Roamers. The Flag Capturer's focus stays on capturing the flag and remain unharmed. Once the enemy is killed, our team will try to bring back our flag to our base, including the Flag Capturer. \\
	\item When the Flag Capturer has a flag and brings it back to the base, but can not deliver it because our flag is captured by the enemy. If this occurs, the Flag Capturer should roam at our base. He should wait until our flag has returned to our base. If he encounters an enemy, he should kill him. When our flag is returned, and the Flag Capturer still has the enemy flag, he should immediately return it to our base.\\
	\item When one of the bots sees an enemy who is far away from him. The bot should switch weapons based on the distance to the enemy. If the enemy is far away, he should switch to weapons who are great for long range, for example the stinger minigun. There is also a switch when the enemy is at mid-range, then he should switch to for example the flak cannon. At last when the enemy is at short-range, he should switch to for example link gun. This feature is a great tactic, because the weapons differ at effectiveness when the range is varied. The bots want to have the best weapon based on the situation, that gives them an advantage. 
\end{enumerate}




\begin{enumerate}
	\item When the Flag capturer captures the enemy flag. His goal is to grab the enemy flag, and when he percepts that he is holding the flag, his goal is to bring it back to his base. If he does not encounter an enemy, he heads straight to the base. When he does encounter an enemy, his priority is killing the enemy. If he succeeds, he continues delivering the flag. Eventually he will be defended by the roamers and Defender, so he can easily run back to his base.\\
	\item When the Flag Defender encounters an enemy. At first, he roams around his own base. If he is stuck, he automatically respawns. When he sees an enemy, his priority is to kill him. When the Defender is hit, he will go grab health. If he is killed by the enemy, the Defender respawns and will roam around his base again. When he sees the same enemy as before, he will again try to kill him. But if he can not see the enemy anymore, he will not try to pursue him, bot stay around the base. With this, the Defender will not leave his position at the base, if he did so, the team would be vulnerable to attacks. The enemy who got away, should then be taken care by the roamers and perhaps the Flag Capturer.\\
	\item When the roamers see an enemy. If they see an enemy, their priority is to kill them. They will pursue the enemy trying to kill them. When the flag capturer has grabbed the enemy flag and runs back to his base, and he is pursued by an enemy, the roamers automatically set their goals to kill them. The fact that the enemy is pursuing the Capturer, is not important. This is what makes the roamers so lethal. \\
	\item When one of the roamers is hit. When the enemy hits one of the roamers, and their health is dropped below 100, he will adopt a new goal to leave the battlefield and grab some health. This will only happen if he sees a health pack. When his health is 100 again, he goes back to defeat the enemy if he sees one. There is also a big health, which boosts it to 180. If the roamer sees one, he will adopt the goal to grab it.\\
	\item When the roamers are low on ammo, or when they see a new weapon, or armor. If they percept that they are low on ammo, the new goal is to grab the ammo. When they have grabbed it, they will continue with what they were doing. If the bot sees a weapon, he will first check if he already has the weapon. If he does not have, his goal will be to pick the weapon up. This also counts for armor, he will first check if he already has this specific armor, if not, he will try to grab it. \\
	\item When the roamers end up capturing the flag. If the roamers does not have any goals, he would be inactive. When he reaches this point, he should go to the enemy base and try to grab the flag. Once he captures the flag, he basically becomes a Flag Capturer, and he will try to deliver it back to his own base. If he encounters an enemy while holding the flag, he will try to defeat him, and when that happens, he will continue delivering the flag.\\ 
	\item When the Flag Capturer sees a weapon. He percepts that there is a weapon, then he looks at his beliefs and checks if he does not own that weapon already. If he owns it, he will continue trying to capture the enemy flag. If he does not owns it, he will adopt the goal to pickup the weapon. After the grabbing it he will continue trying to capture the enemy flag.\\
	\item When the enemy captures our flag. If the flag defender is in the neighborhood, and he sees the enemy, he will try to kill him. This also counts for the Roamers. The Flag Capturer's focus stays on capturing the flag and remain unharmed. Once the enemy is killed, our team will try to bring back our flag to our base, including the Flag Capturer. \\
	\item When the Flag Capturer has a flag and brings it back to the base, but can not deliver it because our flag is captured by the enemy. If this occurs, the Flag Capturer should roam at our base. He should wait until our flag has returned to our base. If he encounters an enemy, he should kill him. When our flag is returned, and the Flag Capturer still has the enemy flag, he should immediately return it to our base.\\
