\subsubsection{Summary}
\subsubsection{Reflection}
At first, I did not think I could really contribute to this project. The Logic Based AI course did not went very well, and my confidence was very low. GOAL was also not working very well, that did not help either. My initial role was secretary, this was during meetings. \\
\noindent
\textbf{Roles}\\
In the beginning I put my focus on making the report. I thought my skills were not good enough to actually make a significant contribution in the code. But I helped with brainstorming a lot, and how we were going to handle certain problems, during the game. An other important role of mine was assisting people. I would help them with tackling their problems, and writing code.\\
\noindent
\textbf{Contributions}\\
In the end, everybody has to contribute to the final product. Everyone had different tasks, to achieve a finished product. The main tasks I had were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] \textbf{Report.} I started with the report. Joshua had a good template for LaTeX, which was very useful. I eventually wrote chapter two and three, and reviewed everything which was added, to eliminate grammar errors and typo's. I also remodeled the report, when we got feedback from our teacher.
	\item[-] \textbf{Assisting.} Whenever someone needed help, because their task was too hard, or too big, I helped them, but only when my own task could wait. This helped fixing major issues, which were blocking the progress of our project.
	\item[-] \textbf{Several strategies.} Another task I had was implementing several strategies. The major ones were weapon equipment, and worked together with someone else, because it was a big task. And the other one was a strategy for following and killing an enemy.
\end{itemize}
