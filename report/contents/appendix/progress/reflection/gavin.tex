\subsubsection{Summary}
\subsubsection{Reflection}
I participated in this project as a member. My role varied quite a lot during the course of this project. There were quite some problems that I met which I will discuss below.

\noindent
\textbf{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] \textbf{Defender.}
My part of work initially included the making of the defender bot. I created the first few versions of the defender and its basic functionalities such as picking first weapon and standing on the flag. Later the job was passed on to Youp, who continued and improved the defender.
\item[-] \textbf{Ammo Strategy.}
After the defender, I made the ammo strategy for the Roamers, and then participated in the refactoring. The ammo module was a result of this, which included a list of weapon ammo to compare and decide if the bot needs to pick up ammo.
\item[-] \textbf{Overlord.}
There were also attempts to create extra functionalities for the overlord. The extra functions included possible role switching during the game, as well as a system where the flag carrier would call out for escort if it is carrying the flag. The functions where eventually scrapped after the decision that the existing code has to be fixed first.
\item[-] \textbf{Report.}
In the last few weeks I devoted my time to making the report, making the Preface, Summary, Conclusion, Bugs and Testing part and checked the report for grammar. After the meeting with the professor of the course technical writing, I rewrote most of the report in subjective tone to address the issue that our report was using objective tone in most parts.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
\textbf{Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] \textbf{Git}
A big problem for me was git, git itself required quite sometime to learn, and merge conflicts were even a bigger problem, there were countless occasions where I had to backup stuff and invoke a hard reset to solve the problems. Whenever I wasn't fast enough with pushing commits, merge conflicts would happen and git often failed at merging. Most of the time I had to backup and hard reset it.
\item[-] \textbf{GOAL plugin}
Another thing that often caused problems for me was the GOAL plugin. The plugin had many bugs which often led to false alarms, crashes. GOAL plugin doesn't recognize modules, and has warnings all over code that ran normally. Moreover, it doesn't recognize the code in modules, representing those in text form, which defeats the purpose of using a IDE on some level.
